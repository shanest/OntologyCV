Ontologies for Cardiovascular System and Applications
=====================================================

The files located in this repository act as a supplement to the PLoS Computational Biology paper 
"_________".

This project generates a cardiovascular application ontology from the Foundational Model of Anatomy.

Furthermore, the generated ontology is then used on an annotated atlas of the human left ventricle in 
order to automate the location of regions of interest.

In particular, the method is applied to data from Siamak et. al 2009 (doi: 10.1007/s10439-009-9677-2).

More details to follow.
